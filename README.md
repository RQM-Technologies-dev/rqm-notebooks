# rqm-notebooks

**Interactive notebooks for learning quaternion geometry, Bloch interpretation, SU(2) rotations, and Qiskit-backed workflows in the RQM ecosystem.**

## Stack placement

```
rqm-core  →  rqm-qiskit  →  rqm-notebooks
math         execution       demos / learning
```

| Layer | Role |
|---|---|
| **rqm-core** | Source of truth for all quaternion, spinor, Bloch sphere, and SU(2) mathematics |
| **rqm-qiskit** | Execution bridge — translates rqm-core types into Qiskit circuits and results |
| **rqm-notebooks** | Interactive demonstration layer — imports from both, adds only display helpers |

`rqm-core` provides the canonical math.
`rqm-qiskit` provides the execution bridge.
`rqm-notebooks` makes the system visible, teachable, and usable.

`qiskit` and `qiskit-aer` are **not** direct dependencies of `rqm-notebooks`; they
arrive as transitive dependencies of `rqm-qiskit`.  All circuit construction and
quantum execution in these notebooks goes through `rqm-qiskit`'s API.

## What you'll learn

| Topic | Description |
|---|---|
| Quaternion components and intuition | What quaternions are, why they matter, and how w/x/y/z encode rotations |
| Spinor ↔ Bloch interpretation | Connecting quantum state vectors to the Bloch sphere |
| SU(2) rotation geometry | SU(2) as the geometry underlying qubit operations |
| Simulator workflows | Sampling, measurement statistics, and circuit execution on Aer |
| IBM-ready path | Preparing circuits for real quantum hardware |

## Start here

Open these notebooks in order:

1. [`notebooks/00_welcome_and_repo_map.ipynb`](notebooks/00_welcome_and_repo_map.ipynb) — orientation and navigation
2. [`notebooks/01_quaternion_intuition.ipynb`](notebooks/01_quaternion_intuition.ipynb) — first principles
3. [`notebooks/05_rqm_qiskit_single_qubit_workflows.ipynb`](notebooks/05_rqm_qiskit_single_qubit_workflows.ipynb) — circuits and execution

## Three audience paths

Depending on your goal, follow one of these tracks:

| Audience | Recommended path |
|---|---|
| **Explorer** — just curious | 00 → 01 → 02 |
| **Quantum developer** — building with the stack | 00 → 05 → 06 |
| **Architecture reader** — understanding the design | 00 → 04 → 05 |

## Quick start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch JupyterLab
jupyter lab notebooks/
```

No IBM account or real quantum hardware is required. All notebooks run on a local Qiskit Aer simulator.

## Architectural rules

- **rqm-core** owns all math. Notebooks must not reimplement quaternion, spinor, Bloch, or SU(2) logic.
- **rqm-qiskit** owns circuit execution. Notebooks call its API, not raw Qiskit directly.
- **rqm-notebooks** declares `rqm-qiskit` as a direct dependency. `qiskit` and `qiskit-aer` are intentionally absent from the declared dependencies — they arrive transitively and are not part of this package's public contract.
- **helpers/** contains only display/formatting utilities — no canonical math.
- No IBM hardware dependency is required to run any notebook by default.
